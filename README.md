The official [lethemfind.us](https://lethemfind.us) URL Shortener
(I was going to update this for HTLL, but I've decided just to make a new one since this is already configured)
((no more changes should be done on this project, as it will not be used and is only for reference))

--------
* Can shorten over 42 billion unique URLs in 6 or less characters (it can do more than 12,000,000 in only 4!)
* Fast: uses very little server resources
* Can be used as an API too
* Options:
    * Turn clickthru tracking on and off
    * Limit usage to 1 IP address for personal use and to prevent spamming from others
    * Check if the URL is real (doesnâ€™t respond with a 404) before shortening
    * Use a cache to minimize database use
    * Change characters for shortlinks
* Only uses alphanumeric characters by default, so all browsers can interpret the URL
* Secure: several data filters in place to prevent SQL injection hacks
* Uses 301 redirects for SEO and analytics yumminess

Installation
------------
* Copy or checkout the files to / on your server
* Update the database info in config.php
